# Bank Customer Churn Prediction using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project predicts customer attrition (churn) in the banking sector using machine learning techniques. It applies feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning to optimize performance.

## Dataset
The dataset used is **Bank Customer.csv**, which includes various customer attributes influencing retention and churn.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualization)

## Installation
To run this project locally, install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Usage
1. Load the dataset and preprocess it (handle missing values, drop unnecessary columns, etc.).
2. Perform feature engineering to enhance model performance.
3. Train machine learning models such as Logistic Regression and Random Forest.
4. Apply hyperparameter tuning to optimize model accuracy.
5. Evaluate model performance using classification metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Results
The model effectively predicts customer churn, helping banks take proactive measures to retain customers.

## How to Run
Run the Jupyter Notebook to execute the machine learning pipeline:
```bash
jupyter notebook Bank_Customer_Churn.ipynb
```
